# node-basic-informational-site

[Live Demo]()

A barebones site with html for practicing node. Built as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) Node course.

_This project was initially built during my first run of the The Odin Project. During my second run I'm reworking few projects and this time I have decided to use TypeScript as a practice._

The website is simple, it runs in localhost and when opened it shows a home with links to an about page and a contact-me page. If the user manually types in any other route they will be served with 404 not found page with a link back to home page.
